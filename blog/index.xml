      <description>I recently downloaded a Java Crackme .jar and looked at what I, as a mortal Java developer, can do with it.
A few years ago, I spent a few days working on reverse engineering and the associated tools such as Ghidra. I can also highly recommend the book Hacking: The Art of Exploitation which should immediately ignite a spark in anyone interested. For me, as someone inexperienced in C, even the introduction to the assembly language was tough going.</description>

      <description>Over the last 10 years, I published at least 20 different websites. Some of them went viral and reached tens of thousands of daily visitors. But most of them went under the radar. For small websites, I had a shared hosting plan. I paid 10$ for unlimited domains on a shared host. Performance was meh. But I had no complaints from the visitors I had. A couple of websites I moved to a dedicated cloud hosting provider, which provides me a powerful server to run wordpress on.</description>

      <title>Vim Ctags Cheat Sheet</title>

      <description>There are dozens of good vim cheat sheets online. Why do another one? This one is a cheat sheet tailored to my workflow for generating ctags. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look.
Generate ctags like this (replace js with whatever language files you want to ignore, if any. I don&amp;rsquo;t code javascript, but my projects contain tons of js files, so I exclude them):
ctags -R -f ~/.ctags --exclude=&#39;*.js&#39; &amp;lt;path-to-project&amp;gt;
If your project contains a language that is not supported by ctags, but is related to another familiar language, you can use langmap.</description>

      <title>I decided Wordpress is for freaks and dumped it</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing wordpress websites for well over 10 years now. Wordpress was working well for me once I was familiar and knew a set of plugins to use. I knew exactly which caching, security, image compression, host, etc. to install to get things running smoothly. Somehow, this still doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel simple enough. No way every website is built like this.
Back in school, I learned that a website is just HTML (for content) and CSS (for styling).</description>
